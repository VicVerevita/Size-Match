## Stories

1. As a customer, I want to be able to earn loyalty points for every purchase I make on the SizeMatch website, so that I can save money on future purchases and feel valued as a customer. This user story would require the development team to implement a loyalty points program and integrate it into the website's checkout process. The team would need to ensure that points are awarded accurately, that customers can easily view their point balance, and that points can be redeemed for discounts on future purchases.

2. As a customer, I want the SizeMatch website to remember my size and send me offers for clothing in that size, so that I can easily find items that fit me well and feel confident in my purchases. This user story would require the development team to create a system for tracking customers' sizes and sending personalized offers based on that information. The team would need to ensure that customers can easily update their size preferences and that offers are relevant and timely.

3. As a member of the SizeMatch development team, I want to be able to easily track website analytics and user feedback, so that we can continually improve the website's performance and user experience. This user story would require the development team to implement analytics tracking and feedback mechanisms throughout the website. The team would need to ensure that data is collected accurately and securely, and that it is used to inform ongoing website improvements. They would also need to ensure that the feedback mechanisms are user-friendly and encourage customers to share their thoughts and opinions.
